# � Gestion‑Entreprise

**Product code training & reference tool • Symfony backend**

A small Symfony application created for a hypothetical grocery business,
allowing staff to look up and memorize product codes and details.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This repo contains a backend system that stores product information,
codes and metadata. It’s intended as a learning aid for employees in an
épicerie (grocery store) to retain item codes and quickly retrieve details.

Key aspects:

- Symfony-based backend with routing and entity management
- Doctrine ORM for product & user records
- Simple authentication to access the dashboard
- Basic Twig views for listing and searching products

The idea is not a full commerce app but a code‑reference and training tool.

---

## 🌐 Features

- ✅ Add, edit and delete products (code, name, description)
- ✅ User login/registration with Symfony security
- ✅ Search product by code or name
- ✅ View product list with pagination
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation and Bootstrap styles

---

## ⚙️ Technologies

- **PHP 8 / Symfony 6** – framework, controllers, security
- **Doctrine ORM** – database layer
- **Twig** – templating engine
- **Bootstrap 5** – basic UI styling
- **MySQL** – database (configured for MAMP)
